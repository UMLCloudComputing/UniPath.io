## Code Style and Quality

- Follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
- Use ESLint and Prettier to enforce code style and quality.
- Ensure code is clean, well-commented, and easy to maintain.

<a name="commit-message-guidelines"></a>
## Commit Message Guidelines

- Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.
- Include meaningful commit messages that explain the changes and why they were made.

<a name="code-reviews"></a>
## Code Reviews

- Submit Pull Requests for code reviews, and ensure at least one other developer reviews your code before merging.
- Address all feedback and ensure all automated checks pass before merging.

<a name="testing-and-coverage"></a>
## Testing and Coverage

- Write unit and integration tests using Jest and React Testing Library.
- Strive for a high level of code coverage, and ensure no regressions are introduced.

<a name="documentation"></a>
## Documentation

- Document code inline using JSDoc-style comments.
- Update README and other documentation files as necessary to reflect changes in the codebase or setup instructions.

<a name="dependency-management"></a>
## Dependency Management

- Keep dependencies up-to-date, and follow semantic versioning.
- Review and understand the licenses of all dependencies to ensure they are compatible with this project's license.

<a name="error-handling"></a>
## Error Handling

- Handle errors gracefully, providing helpful error messages and logging errors as necessary.
- Use custom error classes to differentiate between different types of errors.

<a name="accessibility"></a>
## Accessibility

- Follow the [WCAG guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) to ensure the application is accessible.
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA roles to improve accessibility.

<a name="performance-optimization"></a>
## Performance Optimization

- Optimize images and other assets to reduce load times.
- Use Next.js's built-in image optimization and lazy loading features.

These best practices are aimed at ensuring a high level of code quality and consistency across the UniPath.io codebase, making it easier for developers to contribute and collaborate.
