## üíª Getting Started

<details>
<summary>View contents</summary>

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- Node.js and NPM or Docker for running the application.
- AWS account for AWS Amplify.

### üîΩ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/UMLCloudComputing/UniPath.io.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```sh
    cd UniPath.io
    ```

3. Install NPM packages:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### üõ†Ô∏è Setup AWS Amplify CLI

First, install the AWS Amplify CLI globally:

```sh
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
```

#### Configure Amplify Profile

- Make a new profile: 

    ```sh
    npx amplify configure profile
    ```

    Hit Enter.

    Note: If there's already a profile, then use:

    ```sh
    npx amplify configure profile --name [insert name of profile you want here]
    ```

    It should automatically switch.

#### Add Secrets

1. **Navigate to Amplify Console for Secrets**: For Cloud Computing Club members, go to the [Amplify console (All apps > UniPath.io > Secret management)](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/apps/d3c5lsis3camij/variables) and copy the values for below. For others, you will need to generate your own client ID and secret with your google account.

2. **Configure Google Client ID**:

    ```sh
    amplify configure secret set GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID [your_client_id_here]
    ```

    Replace `[your_client_id_here]` from the client ID above, then paste in the value. Hit enter.

3. **Configure Google Client Secret**:

    ```sh
    amplify configure secret set GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET [your_client_secret_here]
    ```

    Replace `[your_client_secret_here]` from the client secret secret, then paste in the value. Hit enter.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

To run the application locally, you need to run the Amplify sandbox command to create the backend cloud resources and the npm run dev command for the frontend. You will need to keep both commands running in two separate terminals.

Start the Amplify sandbox command. This will provision the AWS backend resources. Keep this command running in the background.

```sh
npx amplify sandbox
```

Open a new terminal and start the frontend application:

```sh
npm run dev
```
