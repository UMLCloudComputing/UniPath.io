## üíª Getting Started

<details>
<summary>View contents</summary>

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- Node.js and NPM or Docker for running the application.
- AWS account for AWS Amplify.

### üîΩ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/UMLCloudComputing/UniPath.io.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```sh
    cd UniPath.io
    ```

3. Install NPM packages:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### üõ†Ô∏è Setup AWS Amplify CLI

First, install the AWS Amplify CLI globally:

```sh
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
```

#### Configure Amplify Profile

- Make a new profile: 

    ```sh
    npx amplify configure profile
    ```

    Hit Enter.

    Note: If there's already a profile, then use:

    ```sh
    npx amplify configure profile --name [insert name of profile you want here]
    ```

    It should automatically switch.

#### Add Secrets

1. **Navigate to Amplify Console for Secrets**: For Cloud Computing Club members, go to the [Amplify console (All apps > UniPath.io > Secret management)](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/apps/d3c5lsis3camij/variables) and copy the values for below. For others, you will need to generate your own client ID and secret with your google account.

2. **Configure Google Client ID**:

    ```sh
    amplify configure secret set GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID [your_client_id_here]
    ```

    Replace `[your_client_id_here]` from the client ID above, then paste in the value. Hit enter.

3. **Configure Google Client Secret**:

    ```sh
    amplify configure secret set GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET [your_client_secret_here]
    ```

    Replace `[your_client_secret_here]` from the client secret secret, then paste in the value. Hit enter.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

To run the application locally, you need to run the Amplify sandbox command to create the backend cloud resources and the npm run dev command for the frontend. You will need to keep both commands running in two separate terminals.

Start the Amplify sandbox command. This will provision the AWS backend resources. Keep this command running in the background.

```sh
npx amplify sandbox
```

Open a new terminal and start the frontend application:

```sh
npm run dev
```

### üîÑ Updating the Project

When developing for UniPath.io, it is important to keep the project up to date with the latest changes. To update the project and pull the latest changes from GitHub, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```sh
    cd UniPath.io
    ```

2. Pull the latest changes from the GitHub repository. It is important to pull the latest changes before creating a new feature branch. 

    ```sh
    git pull
    ```

3. Install NPM packages. This will update the project with the latest dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

That's it! You're all set to start developing with the latest version of UniPath.io.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Contributing

Contributions are what make the open-source community an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

<details>
<summary>Creating a New Branch and Making a Pull Request</summary>

Follow these steps to contribute to the project with a new feature or bug fix:

### Step 1: Create a New Branch
Before starting your work, ensure you're on the `main` branch and that it's up to date.

```sh
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix. Follow a naming convention like `feature/<feature-name>` or `bugfix/<bug-name>`.

```sh
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
# or
git checkout -b bugfix/my-bug-fix
```

### Step 2: Make Your Changes
Implement your feature or fix the bug in your branch. Commit your changes using clear, concise, and conventional commit messages following the guidelines at [conventionalcommits.org](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add my new feature"
# or
git commit -m "fix: correct a bug"
```

Optionally, if you assigned yourself an issue, you can automatically create and link a branch using the GitHub UI. Click on the "Create a branch" button and select the option to create a new branch for the issue.

### Step 3: Push Your Changes
Push your changes to the repository.

```sh
git push origin feature/my-new-feature
# or
git push origin bugfix/my-bug-fix
```

#### Style Guide
- Use clear, concise, and conventional commit messages.
- Follow the best software development practices and write clean, maintainable code.
- For ReactJS, follow this style guide: <https://dev.to/abrahamlawson/react-style-guide-24pp>. Except use indendantation of 4 spaces instead of 2.

### Step 4: Create a Pull Request
Go to the GitHub repository page and click on the "Pull request" button. Select your branch and provide a detailed description of your changes. Explain why your changes should be merged into the main branch.

### Step 5: Review and Merge
Wait for the project maintainers to review your pull request. They may request changes. Once your pull request is approved, a project maintainer will merge it into the main branch.

Thank you for your contribution!
